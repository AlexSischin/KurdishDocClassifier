# Dataset overview

KDC-4007 dataset collection, the Kurdish Documents Classification text for the Sorani dialect.
It is a set of corpus contains about 4,007 articles talking about the following topics:

| â„–   | Category  | Count |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| 1   | religion  | 500   |
| 2   | sport     | 500   |
| 3   | health    | 501   |
| 4   | education | 500   |
| 5   | art       | 501   |
| 6   | social    | 502   |
| 7   | style     | 502   |
| 8   | economy   | 501   |

There are four datasets in the collection:

- ST-Ds. Just stop words elimination is performed by using Kurdish preprocessing-step approach (20150 columns).
- Pre-Ds. Kurdish preprocessing-step approach is used (13128 columns).
- Pre+TW-Ds. TFxIDF term weighting on Pre-Ds dataset is performed (13202 columns).
- Orig-Ds. No process is used which is original dataset (24816 columns).

# Goal

Train an ML algorithm to classify Kurdish Documents. The goal is to make it as accurate as possible, result
interpretation is irrelevant.

Compare the following algorithms:

- Softmax regression (SR)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
- Random forest (RF)

Use cross-validation to compare models and parameters.

# Development

We will use the dataset containing TF-IDF scores for each word. It has 13202 columns. First column is the target, other
are features. We will not perform feature selection and engineering because it's out of the scope of this project.
